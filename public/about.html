<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 25 year old nobody who loves to read books, play video games and wants to fix himself.</p>

<p>Most of my work experience is customer service in Tim Hortons and various CS outsourcing companies where the job was to provide technical support to customers.</p>

<p>I am relearning and adding to my knowledge of coding to get back into the game and actually find my interest in the many options available to coders for a living.</p>
